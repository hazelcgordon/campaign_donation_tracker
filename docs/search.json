However, this might not be representative of actual amounts, because there were many donations made to parties not disclosed until Jan 2020 and put under the label of ‘Q4 2019’ or just at the time period they were eventually reported.\nI’ll also make a graph showing donations from each type of donor to each political party with an average for amount spent, for all donations explicitly listed as pre-poll.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulatedEntityName\nPre-Poll 1 - Party(06/11/19 - 12/11/19) UKPGE 2019\nPre-Poll 2 - Party(13/11/19 - 19/11/19) UKPGE 2019\nPre-Poll 3 - Party(20/11/19 - 26/11/19) UKPGE 2019\nPre-Poll 4 - Party(27/11/19 - 03/12/19) UKPGE 2019\nPre-Poll 5 - Party(04/12/19 - 10/12/19) UKPGE 2019\nPre-Poll 6 - Party(11/12/19 - 12/12/19) UKPGE 2019\n\n\n\n\nConservative and Unionist Party\n£5,673,646\n£2,967,000\n£3,590,500\n£3,201,965\n£2,545,500\n£1,392,297\n\n\nLabour Party\n£ 218,500\n£3,488,000\n£ 521,909\n£1,017,417\n£ 165,471\n£ 0\n\n\nLiberal Democrats\n£ 275,000\n£ 251,000\n£ 509,998\n£ 80,000\n£ 130,000\n£ 0\n\n\nGreen Party\n£ 30,000\n£ 37,750\n£ 100,000\n£ 50,000\n£ 24,727\n£ 0\n\n\nAdvance Together [De-registered 01/10/20]\n£ 0\n£ 0\n£ 0\n£ 22,750\n£ 39,750\n£ 0\n\n\nReform UK\n£ 250,000\n£2,250,000\n£ 0\n£ 125,000\n£1,475,000\n£ 50,000\n\n\nPlaid Cymru - The Party of Wales\n£ 0\n£ 70,000\n£ 0\n£ 0\n£ 0\n£ 0\n\n\nAlliance - Alliance Party of Northern Ireland\n£ 60,000\n£ 0\n£ 15,000\n£ 0\n£ 0\n£ 0\n\n\nScottish National Party (SNP)\n£ 0\n£ 10,000\n£ 0\n£ 0\n£ 0\n£ 14,929\n\n\nSinn Féin\n£ 0\n£ 0\n£ 0\n£ 14,465\n£ 0\n£ 0\n\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party - D.U.P.\n£ 0\n£ 0\n£ 0\n£ 19,425\n£ 0\n£ 0\n\n\nRenew\n£ 0\n£ 0\n£ 0\n£ 15,000\n£ 0\n£ 0\n\n\nWomen's Equality Party\n£ 0\n£ 0\n£ 0\n£ 0\n£ 20,000\n£ 0"
